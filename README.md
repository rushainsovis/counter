# Counter

```
name: Counter
on: push
jobs:
    test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Get Code
              uses: actions/checkout@v3
            - name: Install NodeJS
              uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            - name: Install Dependencies
              run: npm ci
            - name: Run Tests
              run: npm test
```
This is a GitHub Actions workflow file that automates certain tasks when code is pushed to the repository. Let me break it down for you step by step:

### 1. **Workflow Name**
   ```yaml
   name: Counter
   ```
   - This sets the name of the workflow to "Counter". It's an arbitrary name and can be anything that makes sense to you.

### 2. **Trigger Event**
   ```yaml
   on: push
   ```
   - This specifies that the workflow will be triggered when there is a push event to the repository. This could be any type of push (to any branch), unless further restrictions are set.

### 3. **Jobs Section**
   ```yaml
   jobs:
       test:
           runs-on: ubuntu-latest
   ```
   - This defines a job named `test` under the `jobs` section.
   - `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` means that the job will run on a virtual machine with the latest version of Ubuntu.

### 4. **Steps to be Executed**
   - Within the `test` job, there are several steps that will be executed in sequence:

#### Step 1: Get Code
   ```yaml
   - name: Get Code
     uses: actions/checkout@v3
   ```
   - This step checks out the latest version of the repository's code onto the runner (the virtual machine) using the `actions/checkout@v3` action.

#### Step 2: Install Node.js
   ```yaml
   - name: Install NodeJS
     uses: actions/setup-node@v3
   ```
   - This step sets up Node.js on the runner using the `actions/setup-node@v3` action. It automatically installs the Node.js environment that the project needs to run.

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
   ```yaml
   - name: Install Dependencies
     run: npm ci
   ```
   - This step runs `npm ci`, which is a command that installs the project dependencies based on the `package-lock.json` file. It ensures a clean and reproducible installation, which is ideal for CI/CD pipelines.

#### Step 4: Run Tests
   ```yaml
   - name: Run Tests
     run: npm test
   ```
   - This step runs the project's test suite using `npm test`. Typically, `npm test` will execute a testing framework like Jest, Mocha, or others based on how it's configured in the project.

### Summary:
In simple terms, this workflow runs whenever code is pushed to the repository. It:
1. Checks out the code.
2. Sets up Node.js.
3. Installs the necessary dependencies.
4. Runs the tests to ensure everything works as expected.

This is a basic example, but you can extend it with additional steps like linting, deployment, etc., depending on your needs.
